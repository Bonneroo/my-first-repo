# Nienna Divergent Backstory

## What happens when our troubled elf goes rogue ##
*Reasoning behind first level of rogue*

- The thing about growing up on the streets is: it makes the shadows your closest friend
- Perched up among the limbs *Safe*, Nienna pondered the last few days' events. Sure, she had [...]; had it been worth it?
- Her thoughts drifted to her eye *fear* and toward her bow *comfort*. The reactions of the people whom she met along the way **Freak**.
- Rattling through her mind, clinging to each of these thoughts was a smaller notion. One she hadn't felt since meeting her new adventuring group *friends*
- *Have you forgotten me already?*
- The shadows beckoned *cold*, and she entered their embrace

## Sometimes we have to kill ##
*Time to pick an archetype, darkest timeline*

- **Not again. Please not again**
- Blood soaked hands hold Daniel's lifeless body. Through tear clouded eyes his mother swims into her view.
- Running
- **Failure**
- Nienna sits alone. The shadows *cold comfort* surround Her
- *My failure. My lot in life*
- *Twice I couldn't save them*
- *I'm not meant to save*
- Amid the chaos in her mind **WHY?**, one thought rings out.
- *They were right.*
- Nienna Laurelin was never meant to be a savior. She is a tool.
- A dagger in the dark *Home*; steel quenched in blood.
- Tonight the shadows flicker around her, their macabre dance conveying a haunting grace.
- Nienna closes her eyes, lets go of what's left of her remorse, and joins the cadence.

## Cajoling Shadows ##
*Time to pick an archetype, any other timeline*

- *This is an odd feeling*
- The night dances around Nienna as it always has, but somehow something is new.
- *Has there always been this feeling?*
- Daniel's death dances in her mind, but is swept away in the dance of the night *acceptance*.
- The distant light flickers, and the shadows pull her in to their joyous cadence *lightness*.

*There is a certain magic in the dark*
